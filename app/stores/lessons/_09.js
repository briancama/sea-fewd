Today we will go over Conditions, and how you can add “Control Flow” to your applications. We will also review Functions again to make sure we grasp this important concept. Lastly, we will go over Arrays, a JavaScript Object that allows you to store list-like data.",

You should store the image URLs in an Array, and use that Array to update the image path with the user transitions to another photo. You should also store the score they give each image in an Array."
