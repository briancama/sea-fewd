  description: "In this lesson, we will go over GitHub - how our class will use it and how it's used throughout the industry. After setting up GitHub, we'll jump into HTML. This will be a review if you went through Dash or had some experience with HTML in the past. We will cover the structure of HTML and how it is meant to be declarative of your content. Depending how fast we go through the content, we may cover other ways to use Git and GitHub, the course website and structure, and any general questions.",
